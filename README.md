# Keybase_Proof_for_Mastodon

This is my own implementation/attempt to make a Keybase proof for Mastodon.
It uses the Keybase Filesystem to host a signed webpage which has been verified via Keybase.
That webpage also houses a GPG signed message which can be verified via Keybase for puposes of proving Mastodon account ownership.
